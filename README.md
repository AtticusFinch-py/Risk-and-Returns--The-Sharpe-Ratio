# Investment Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing the performance of two tech giants, Amazon and Facebook, in comparison to the S&P 500 benchmark. The primary focus is on calculating and understanding the Sharpe Ratio, a widely used measure in finance for assessing the risk-adjusted return of an investment.

## Project Overview

In finance, making investment decisions involves not only considering the expected returns but also assessing the associated risks. The Sharpe Ratio, introduced by Professor William Sharpe, provides a method for comparing different investments by calculating the additional return per unit of risk.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Import and Preparation:**
   - The project begins with importing daily stock data for Amazon and Facebook, as well as the S&P 500 benchmark.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - A preliminary look at the data is essential. This step involves visualizing and summarizing daily prices for Amazon and Facebook, as well as the S&P 500.

3. **Calculating Daily Returns:**
   - To compute the Sharpe Ratio, daily returns for both stocks and the benchmark are calculated.

4. **Excess Returns Calculation:**
   - The relative performance of stocks against the S&P 500 is determined by calculating the difference in returns.

5. **Sharpe Ratio Calculation:**
   - The Sharpe Ratio is computed using the average difference in daily returns and the standard deviation of the return difference.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The project concludes by interpreting the Sharpe Ratios and making a decision based on the risk-adjusted returns of Amazon and Facebook.
